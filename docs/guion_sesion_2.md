# SESSION 2: SOFTWARE COMPONENTS OF PETALINUX
In this session we are learning on how to take advantage of the system we have built with our own hands in the previous session.

Linux is not just some piece of static fancy software that is running on a computer so that you can show off to your friends...

In this session, we are going to learn how to edit every single piece of code, used from the buildup of the kernel, going thorugh the bootloader process to the final enduser software that will be running in our platform.

Also, if time is on our side and the Fortune Goddess smiles us, we can also learn how to add the end software after having being tested, to a prebuilt Linux image so that the end user doesn't have to worry about downloading any extra packages.
